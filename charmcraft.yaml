        What to do when /books/ contains something already. Options are:
        skip (do nothing),
        clean (delete the contents of /books/ and then extract the provided library or the default if none is provided).
        Changing this value after storage has already been attached will immediately re-run the storage attached event handler,
        potentially resulting in cleaning the current contents of /books/.

# removed library-write option:
        #overwrite (extract the provided library on top of the existing one if one is provided),
